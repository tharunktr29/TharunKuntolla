# Tharun Kuntolla
Full-Stack Software Engineer (React / Angular + .NET Core) | Cloud (Azure/AWS) | Microservices | CI/CD

I build scalable, performance-focused web applications and APIs, with strong emphasis on clean architecture, reliability, and measurable outcomes.

## What I’m good at
- **Frontend:** React, Angular, TypeScript, performance tuning, component design systems
- **Backend:** .NET Core (C#), REST APIs, microservices, background jobs, caching
- **Data:** SQL Server, query optimization, data modeling

- **Quality:** unit/integration testing, API observability, structured logging

## Featured Projects (real-world style)
### 1) Resilient API Integration (.NET 8)
- Built resilient HTTP integration with timeouts, retries (exponential backoff + jitter), and circuit breaker patterns
- Structured logging and failure visibility using Serilog
- Focus: reliability, maintainability, and production readiness
